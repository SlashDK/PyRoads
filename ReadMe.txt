PyRoads is a pseudo 3D game with requires jumping from tile to tile to reach the end of the level. The project includes the game itself with some premade levels as well as a level creator. 

The game requires you to move forward (actually you remain stationary and the level moves backwards). You have to jump and move left and right to reach tiles. If you don’t get on tiles, you fall off the map and lose. Some of the tiles have special abilities such as taking you to max speed and reducing your speed. There are also tiles that cause you to die if you make touch them. The tiles that win the level are always at the end of the level.

The level creator allows you to design your own levels and save them in the levels/ folder.

The program uses pygame and is written in python3. 

The game should be run by compiling MainScreen.py, with all other files in the same folder and a subfolder named “levels” also present in the same folder.
